## Eko
This app has been a passion project of mine over the past couple years. Magic Budget is a Disney Parks budget planning app. Me and my husband absolutely love going to the parks but we always find ourselves coming over budget (too many churros). I built this app to help solve this problem! I found the estimated price for many of the popular items in the parks so users can quickly budget for what they might buy on their trip.
